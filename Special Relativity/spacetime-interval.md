## Infinitesimal spacetime interval
Let us work in local coordinates $x^\mu = \left( ct, x^i \right)$ where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. Suppose we were to track the motion of a pulse of light, in some inertial frame. By the second [[postulates|postulate]] of SR, this speed would be the same in all inertial frames.

Let the 3-position of a pointlike pulse of light be $x^i$. Then, its speed squared is,

$c^2 = \frac{d x_i}{dt} \frac{d x^i}{dt}$

Or,

$$c^2 dt^2 - dx_i dx^i = 0$$

Trajectories $x^i \left( t \right)$ obeying the above condition are called null or lightlike trajectories. From their definition, it follows that a lightlike trajectory is lightlike in all inertial frames. The above quantity is also written as $ds^2 = c dt^2 = dx_i dx^i$. $ds$ is called the infinitesimal spacetime interval.

As $c$ is invariant,

$$c^2 dt^2 - dx_i dx^i = c^2 d{t^\prime}^2 - dx_{i^\prime} dx^{i^\prime} = 0$$


## Minkowski metric
As it turns out, we can write the line element as an inner product, of the form,

$ds^2 = dx_\mu dx^\mu$

if we define,

$$dx_\mu = \left( cdt, - dx_i \right)$$

Equivalently, the dual $dx_\mu$ of $dx^\mu$ can be obtained via a metric tensor which will be called the Minkowski metric $\eta_{\mu \nu}$,

$x_\mu = \eta_{\mu \nu} x^\nu$, and,

$ds^2 = dx^\mu dx_\mu = dx^\mu \eta_{\mu \nu} dx^\nu$

It follows(in local coordinates),

$$\begin{align} \eta_{00} & = 1 \\ \eta_{ij} & = - g_{ij} \\ \eta_{\mu 0} & = \eta_{0 \mu} = 0 \end{align}$$

where $g_{ij}$ is the spatial metric for the given coordinate system.
