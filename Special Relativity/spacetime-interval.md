# Spacetime interval

Let us work in local coordinates $x^\mu = \left( ct, x^i \right)$ where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. Suppose we were to track the motion of a pulse of light, in some inertial frame. By the second [[postulates|postulate]] of SR, this speed would be the same in all inertial frames.

Let the 3-position of a pointlike pulse of light be $x^i$. Then, its speed squared is,

$c^2 = \frac{d x_i}{dt} \frac{d x^i}{dt}$

Or,

$$c^2 dt^2 - dx_i dx^i = 0$$

Trajectories $x^i \left( t \right)$ obeying the above condition are called null or lightlike trajectories. From their definition, it follows that a lightlike trajectory is lightlike in all inertial frames.

For the above quantity to be invariant,
