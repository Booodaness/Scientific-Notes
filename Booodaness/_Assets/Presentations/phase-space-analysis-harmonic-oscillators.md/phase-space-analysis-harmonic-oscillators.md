- One of the most influential mathematicians of all time, Henri PoincarÃ©, once said,

> Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.

- A very good morning to one and all present here today. My name is Sid and I am currently in my 1A term, studying mathematical physics. I thank you for being here today and welcome you to join me in this PHYS 10 seminar. 

- So in this seminar, we will study harmonic oscillators using a really cool method called phase space analysis. Sit back and tie your spring-loaded seat belts!

# What is a harmonic oscillator?

--

## Defining harmonic oscillators

--

+ The answer depends on the framework of physics under consideration.

+ In classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system which when displaced by a position vector $\vec{x}$, experiences a restoring force $\vec{F} = -k \vec{x}$ (Hooke's law) where $k$ is a constant depending on the nature of the system (called its 'spring constant').

+ In general, a harmonic oscillator is a system whose tendency to return to some state of stable equilibrium is linearly related to its displacement about the equilibrium point.

--

## Examples of harmonic oscillators

--

+ A spring gently displaced from equilibrium within its elastic limit.

+ A simple pendulum displaced from its mean position by a small angle.

+ The batter head of a drum.

+ The electromagnetic field (as a system of infinite coupled harmonic oscillators in space and in time). Excitations of the electromagnetic field are called photons.

+ Lattices of atoms are chains of harmonic oscillators. Excitations of these lattices are called phonons.

note:

- The study of excitations in electromagnetic field, condensed matter, etc. gives rise to quantum field theories or QFTs. And QFTs are the marriage of the special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, giving rise the most accurate model of nature we have so far. For instance, everything we know today about particle physics is based on QFTs.

- To summarize, harmonic oscillators capture a surprisingly diverse range of fundamental phenomena in nature. Hence, it is worthwhile to study them.

# How does a harmonic oscillator evolve?

## Equation of motion

note: To understand how a harmonic oscillator evolves, we will look at its equation of motion. For brevity, we will deal with only linear motion.

--

From Hooke's law, we have that the position of a harmonic oscillator about its mean position, $x \left( t \right)$, obeys,

$$F = -k x$$

--

But from Newton's second law of motion, $F = ma$ and $a$ is defined to be $\frac{d^2}{dt^2} x \left( t \right)$. Hence,

$$\boxed{m \frac{d^2}{dt^2} x \left( t \right) = - k x \left( t \right)}$$
