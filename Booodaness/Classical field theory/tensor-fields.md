## Tuple index notation
To make the tensor notation a little less messy, let us use the [[tensors#Components|tuple index notation]], where tuples of indices are replaced by their capital letter. For example, $\phi^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p}_{\phantom{\mu_1 \dots \mu_p} \nu_1 \dots \nu_q}$ is written as $\phi^M_{\phantom{M} N}$.

## Postulates
Classical tensor fields are postulated to obey the following principles:

1. **Locality**: Changes in a tensor field [[spacetime-interval#No body can travel faster than light|cannot propagate faster than light]], in any given reference frame.
2. **Lorentz invariance**: Tensor fields are [[tensors#Invariance|invariant]] in all reference frames. Thus, [[tensors#Components|components]] of tensor fields [[tensors#Components|transform like tensors]], with the Jacobian representing a [[lorentz-transformations|Lorentz transformation]]. 
3. **Principle of stationary action**: There are functionals on a given tensor field, such that on-shell evolutions are stationary i.e. varying the field does not vary the action, up to first-order.
4. **Gauge invariance**: The dynamics of tensor fields are [[gauge-invariance|invariant]] under [[gauge-invariance#gauge-transformations|gauge transformations]].
