# The postulates of SR

Special relativity (abbreviated as SR), roughly put, is the theory of dynamics that respects the following postulates:

1. The laws of science are invariant in all inertial frames (principle of relativity).
2. The speed of light is a 'law of science', and is therefore, invariant in all frames.
3. Space and time are homogeneous.

The first two postulates were proposed by Albert Einstein in his revolutionary 1905 paper *On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies*. The third postulate is often neglected in textbooks, but is still used directly in many derivations. Therefore, we have mentioned it explicitly.
