#SR #Lorentz-transformations 

## Mathematical definition
[[spacetime-interval#Lorentz transformations|Recall]] that a Lorentz transformation $\pmb{\Lambda}$ is a map that obeys,

$$\det \left( \pmb{\Lambda}^T \pmb{\Lambda} \right) = 1$$

## Types
Lorentz transformations form a 6-parameter group (the Lorentz group), which we shall see later. Of these, 3 parameters represent 3-rotations and the other 3 parameters, Lorentz boosts parameterized by 3-velocities. Any Lorentz transformation is a direct product of a 3-rotation and a Lorentz boost.

### 3-rotations
A 3-rotation $\pmb{R}$ is a transformation which preserves the spacelike part of the spacetime interval. By [[spacetime-interval#Lorentz transformations|methods]] similar to the ones used to derive the previous equation, it follows,

$$\det \left( \pmb{R}^T \pmb{R} \right) = 1$$

### Lorentz boosts
A Lorentz boost $\pmb{\Lambda}$ along a basis vector $\pmb{e}_i$ is a Lorentz transformation from unprimed to primed inertial frames, constrained to move uniformly with respect to each other along the direction of $\pmb{e}_i$.

(A general Lorentz transformation is a Lorentz boost along some direction $\pmb{e}_i$, parameterized by the velocity component $v^i$ ; followed by a rotation that makes $\pmb{e}_i$ line up with some $\pmb{e}_j$, some $\pmb{e}_k$ with $\pmb{e}_j$ and so on; followed by a Lorentz boost along $\pmb{e}_j$ parameterized by $v^j$; etcetera.)

Consider the restricted motion of a single point particle along the $x$ direction. We will work in an unprimed inertial frame $K$ and transform the coordinates to a primed inertial frame $K^\prime$.
