## A related project

The main reason to make the notes in this repository is to assimilate various ideas in physics and mathematics, and ultimately be able to use and share the concepts learned.

To post my thoughts, I maintain the blog [Tempus Spatium](https://booodaness.github.io/tempus-spatium/), dedicated to physics, mathematics and philosophy. Many posts on the site are notes from this repository, but converted into a more readable and less personal format. So, feel free to visit the blog!

Last but not the least, happy reading!
