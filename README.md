Regularly updated notes on topics in physics and mathematics, that I find myself returning to frequently.

This repository is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

## To view locally

1. [Download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download). (You could alternatively use Markdown processors such as [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) or [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/), but some features such as wikilinks, extended markdown etc. may be unavailable).

2. Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), then open Git bash and clone this repository into your system:

## A related project

The main reason to make the notes in this repository is to assimilate various ideas in physics and mathematics, and ultimately be able to use and share the concepts learned.

To post my thoughts, I maintain the blog [Tempus Spatium](https://booodaness.github.io/tempus-spatium/), dedicated to physics, mathematics and philosophy. Many posts on the site are notes from this repository, but converted into a more readable and less personal format. So, feel free to visit the blog!

Last but not the least, happy reading!
