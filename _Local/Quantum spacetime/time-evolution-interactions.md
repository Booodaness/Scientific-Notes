## Measurement
Let us introduce an apparatus $\mathcal{A}$ into a quantum spacetime which measures an observable compatible with the Hamiltonian and hence, projects the state to some [[eigennetworks|eigennetwork]]. As per the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the outcome of such an event is purely probabilistic, with the probability given by the [[_Local/Quantum spacetime/postulates#Statements|Born rule]].
