## Size
The size of an eigennetwork is simply the number of nodes contained in it, $n = \left\lvert V \right\rvert$. It is [[Booodaness/Special Relativity/postulates|postulated]] to be constant for a given spacetime.

## Graphical structure
An eigennetwork consists of a set of [[discrete-structures#Nodes|nodes]] $V = \left\{ x_i \vert i = 1, \dots, n \right\}$ and a set of [[discrete-structures#Undirected edges|undirected edges]] linking arbitrary and distinct nodes, $E = \left\{ \left\{ x_i, x_j \right\} \vert i \neq j; x_i, x_j \in V \right\}$. Formally, this structure is called a [[discrete-structures#Graphical structure|graph]], which is the ordered pair $G = \left( V, E \right)$.

## Degeneracy
In the 4th postulate, we see that eigennetworks which are transformable into one another by renaming the nodes, must have the same energy eigenvalues by virtue of being isomorphic.

Given an eigennetwork, it is useful to compute the total number of degenerate states corresponding to it, which is also the number of isomorphisms on that eigennetwork. But before proceeding, we will have to find a useful way to characterize the topology of an eigennetwork, in order to convert the problem into one of combinatorics.
