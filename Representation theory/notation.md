# Notation

1. All tensorial objects are written in boldface. This includes basis vectors and covectors, as they remain invariant under a change of coordinates (what really changes is the labels we associate with our choice of basis).

2. Dummy indices are summed over, according to the Einstein summation convention.

3. Bilinear products are written in calligraphic font to distinguish them from ordinary tensors.

4. Tuples of indices are represented by their capital letters, even if the indices belong to different tensors, in which case the tensors are being multiplied in some form, such as through the tensor product, or by multiplying the components. Jump to [[tensors#Components|Components]] to understand this better.
